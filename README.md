# VDSR-Keras
### Overview
This VDSR code is based on [GeorgeSeif's VDSR-Keras](https://github.com/GeorgeSeif/VDSR-Keras).

I modified the code for using.
This code is intended to be simpler and more convinient to use than the original one.

### Usage
* Put your dataset folder into `data` directory.
* Set parameters to your data [here](https://github.com/YongWookHa/VDSR-Keras/blob/f810543f700717a2e1ae884c2f409ac0265e88a5/vdsr.py#L16)
